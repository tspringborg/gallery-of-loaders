# Gallery of loaders
A place to keep old loaders for public viewing.

### Add a loader

Copy `./loaders/example-loader` or make a new folder in `./loaders` dir.

Change `index.json` to only include your newly created loader path

Run `./index.html` in a webserver however you like

```
## Example with python
python3 -m http.server
```

Work on your loader until satisfied.

Make a PR with your changes, omitting `index.json`

Thanks!
